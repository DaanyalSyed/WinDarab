## Program Start

After starting WinDarab the user interface appears in which the last edited desktop (see chapter Desktop) or new desktop is opened. A new desktop will open if WinDarab is started the first time.
 
WinDarab offers a structured user interface with several components:

* **Color** window arranged bottom right allows you to pick a color for an element (for instance a channel in an analysis window).

* **Oscilloscope**, **Analysis** Window, **Instrument Panel** resides in the middle of WinDarab and represents data or results of the calculations that are performed.
 
## Important Tips

Keyboard
- Right next to some menu items you will also see keystroke combinations that allow you to perform functions from your keyboard. Using your keyboard rather than the mouse to execute frequently used functions saves a great deal of time.
 
Context Menu
- The context menu of an element (window, channel etc.) contains a list of frequently used and useful functions. It is opened by clicking with the right mouse button on the element. In case the element has a zoom function, the context menu is opened by using the *middle mouse button*, or the *left and right mouse buttons*.
