---|---
Area  |  Refers to the horizontal division of a Oscilloscope in which channel signals are displayed.
Base Directory | A Base Directory represents a link to a particular folder on the hard drive (--> network). WinDarab saves data in sub-folders within a specified base directory.
Base Directory for Calculating Differences | Logged Data Directory that provides channel values (for the second channel) for calculating a difference.
Bit Area | See Area
CAN | **C**ontroller **A**rea **N**etwork
CanCard | Most commonly used hardware for data recording. A more recent device is CardMemory.
 Channels | Separate data signals within a recording.
Conditions | A condition is a linked set of mathematical criteria that must be met in a specific sample in order for that data sample to be included in an evaluation.
Configuration | A particular arrangement of channels, which can be loaded and displayed in a Oscilloscope.
Darab Explorer | Darab Explorer is used in WinDarab to manage Racetrack and Logged Data Files.
Data Logger | Data Logging Device for Measurement Channels
Differences | The Differences Channel is a special channel that calculates values for the difference resulting from a comparison of the same channel in two different Logged Data Files.
DLS | Data Logging System (consists of C55 Data Logger and MSI Devices)
DOS Format | DOS Darab, WinDarabâ€™s precursor, uses a data format that cannot be directly processed by WinDarab.
ECU | Engine Control Unit
Grid | Grid lines which can be displayed in a Oscilloscope. 
Logged Data File | A Logged Data File contains all data recorded in a vehicle. 
Racetrack or Racecourse | A Racetrack or Racecourse is the location where vehicle data recording has taken place. WinDarab assumes that the selected racetrack corresponds to the racetrack where data was actually recorded.
