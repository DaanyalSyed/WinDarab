<tr><td><b>Known Hardware Problems</b></td>
<td>During development of the 3D functions we got several problems with certain graphic chips. Our developers tried to work solve these problems but still, we have known problems concerning certain chip sets and their drivers: <ul><li>Chipset S3 Savage IX/VX</li></ul><br/>The Windows XP drivers are very slow if the mouse cursor is inside of a 3D drawing area.<br/>Additionally the driver causes sometimes blue screens. <br/><br/>Our developers made best experience with graphic chips like ATI Radeon or Nvidia.</td></tr>
