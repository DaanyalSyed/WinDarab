## File Explorer
The usability of WinDarab’s File Explorer is much the same way as Windows’ *Windows Explorer*. 

File Explorer is used to manage all WinDarab supported files:

* WinDarab 7 files
* WinDarab 6 files
* WDServer Telemetry files
* Linked files
* MDF Files
* MSX files
 
<table><tr><td><b>Hint</b></td>
<td>In addition to access files on existing disk drives you access them through locations. A location in fact represents the affiliation of files with a specific drive and folder. Using locations simplifies access and management of files. See chapter Locations</td></tr></table>

The File Explorer window is divided into:

1.  Open File dialog box
2.  File Inform window
 
The Open File dialog box allows you to browse through drives, folders, locations and select the file you want to open.

This area displays sub-folders and files contained in the selected folder.

To select an item you can either use your keyboard or your mouse. Whenever possible a preview of the selected file will be displayed.

If the selected file has a password protection act as shown in Open Password-protected Files.

* If you use the Shift-key while pressing the “Open” button, the “open linked files”-dialog appears. In this dialog you can change the order of the linked files, delete single files from the list or save the list as a predefined filegroup in the same folder as the used files are saved in.
