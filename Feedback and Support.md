## Sending Bug Reports

Bug reports can be created through WinDarab natively or in Windows and submitted to Bosch Motorsport for review. Bosch Motorsport is constantly working to improve WinDarab. If possible please use the latest version of WinDarab to see if your bug had already been resolved.

### Creating Bug Report Content

There are three components to maximize Bug Report effectiveness.

- Problem Description
  - Video and Pictures Help
  - Work-flow to Reproduce Issue
  - Computer OS and WinDarab Version
- Crashdumps
  - WinDarab Generated
  - Windows Generated
- Associated Files
  - Formulas
  - Desktop
  - Data Files

Crashdumps can be created by WinDarab in two ways. Both methods write the crashdump files to: %WinDarab Install%/Minidump folder location. If large data sets or desktops are open please give it some time to create two files.
- Automatically: WinDarab attempts to create crashdumps automatically when a crash is detected. If this happens the picture below will be shown when the crash occurs:

- Manually: Press Left Ctrl + Right Shift + F10 and hold for 2 seconds. The window below will show up, click yes to create the crashdump.

Crashdumps can also be created by Windows by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc then right click on the WinDarab process and select Create Dump File. This will create a .dmp file in a location specified by Windows. This method is usually only requried if WinDarab is unable to make its own crashdump or Bosch Motorsport requests the Windows crashdump.

### Submitting Bug Report
Send the three parts of the crashdump to your Bosch Motorsport support dealer or person via the method of your choosing. The dealer or Bosch Motorsport representative will follow up if there is additional information requested.
